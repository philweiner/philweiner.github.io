Unbeknownst to most consumers, how salad makes its way through the supply chain is far from fresh and safe.

The very processes intended to clean, remove, and prevent contamination (triple-washing) creates a cesspool of germs that then makes its way home to the consumer. This chain of events induces 10 million health cases annually and allows 1 billion pounds of salad to end up in the landfill each year in the US.","targetRectangle":{"y":297.74569702148438,"x":834.18865966796875,"width":1022.3541873909408,"height":595}},{"text":"Growing at home is becoming a more and more desirable solution for many Americans due to rising food prices, food safety concerns, and heightened interest in eco-friendly living.
