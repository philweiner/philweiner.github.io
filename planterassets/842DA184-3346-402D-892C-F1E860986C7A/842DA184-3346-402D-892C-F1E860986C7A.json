When exposed to sunlight on extremely hot days, water can reach near-boiling temperatures, thereby damaging plant leaves. The water reservoir had to be kept out of direct sunlight. We chose to have water move from below the plants by way of a pump strong enough to push water up two feet and disperse it across a two-foot radius, also requiring AC power and a long enough cord. To minimize potential damage during harvest, we designed a pressure driven piston that would raise when the pump is on and recess when not in use. Plants take up water through roots in wet-to-dry cycles, so proper drainage is drilled into each module that diverts into a catchment where excess water can evaporate.

The diameter of the Planter was selected based on an average of arm lengths so a user could harvest from any edge.

Clean and untouched water is insulated in the core, away from sunlight and debris. The water is brought up to the “atmosphere” and rains across the soil layer.
